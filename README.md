# GIFTs
The Generate IWXXM From TAC software (GIFTs) repository has moved to my personal GitHub account due to my retirement from the National Weather Service. I will continue to support and update the software when IWXXM 2025-2 (Amd 82) is officially released by the WMO.

GIFTs code repository is [here](https://github.com/mgoberfield/GIFTs).
